# Play against Stockifish on your browser 


## UX Design 

The project is an attempt to play Chess against a Chess-engine on the browser.Built on top of Chess.js(Rules for Chess),chessboard.js(chessboard :css+html+jquery) 
and Stockfish.js(Chess engine) .



+ The Skeleton Layout:


    - A Header : Contains the chess engine logo(stockfish) and link to highlight rankings 
    - Nav bar with interatcivty : A  Navbar for allowing users to start a new game , switch sides and choose difficulties
    - The main body which contains chessboard 

Initial wireframe used for developing a prototype ,which was later discarded due to time restrictions:
