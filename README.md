# Play against Stockifish on your browser 


The project is an attempt to play Chess against a Chess-engine on the browser.Built on top of [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
(Rules for Chess),[chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/)(chessboard :css+html+jquery) 
and [Stockfish.js](https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js)(Chess engine).


## UX Design

    - A Header : Contains the chess engine logo(stockfish) and link to highlight rankings 
    - Nav bar with interatcivty : A  Navbar for allowing users to start a new game , switch sides and choose difficulties
    - The main body which contains chessboard 

Initial wireframe used for developing a prototype ,which was later discarded due to time restrictions:
